# Recreating Zork 285 in ZIL - Part 8 - Verb actions: look, take and drop
This is part 8 in an ongoing series. The previous part: "Part 7 - Matching the syntax" is [here](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/doc/zork285_07.md).  
  
In this part we will return to the main loop and start examining the verb actions. From the description of the main loop in [part 4](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/doc/zork285_04.md) we see that after the input is parsed, the verb action is first to handle the input.
```
print room description
loop_start
   print prompt
   input text
   advance move counter
   parse text
   if parse ok and verb ok do verb action
      if verb action ok do eventual room action
   if nothing have been printed yet, print "Nothing happens."
   do DEMONS (interrupts)
loop_end
```
## The verb actions
Below are the verb listed and grouped, with its corresponding action from [part 2](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/doc/zork285_04.md), in a more conceptual way. 
```

```
The verb action ```ACT-HACK``` is a special case. These verbs will call the direct and indirect objects action function (if there is one). We will return to ``Ã€CT-HACK``` in a later part.
## Printing the rooms description
The verb ```LOOK``` has the action ```ROOM-DESC``` that calls ```ROOM-INFO``` with parameter that forces full description to be printed. ```ROOM-INFO``` is also called when the player enters a room. I we list the relevant functions side by side it is easy to see how similar they are ([```ROOMS 154```](https://https://github.com/MITDDC/zork-1977-07/blob/main/zork/9005183/marc/rooms.154) and [```rooms.zil```](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/rooms.zil)).

```
A couple of notes: 
* ```<IFFLAG (DEBUG <TELL "ROOM-INFO" CR>)>``` is a line that will print debug information if the debug flag is set when compiling and can be ignored here.
* The ```TELL-FLAG``` is a global variable that is set to false before each new input from the user. Then if a function prints something to the screen it is set to true. If the flag is still false after all parsing is done the main loop will print "Nothing happens.".
* Lines that start with ```<AND <NOT ,PATCHED>...``` is only there to sometimes force in an odd extra line feed in order to replicate the erratic behavior of the original.
  
The first block is to print the room description. There are a couple of alternatives:  
  
1. If the room is dark and there is no light source print the "dark" message and exit.  
2. If we been here before and not a full description (```LOOK```) is ordered; then there is an 80 percent chance only the short description (```RDESC2```) is printed.  
3. If there is no long description (```RDESC1```); then we call the rooms action function with the verb ```LOOK``` and let the room action handle it.  
4. Otherwise we print the long room description (```RDESC1```).  
  
The next block iterates over all objects in the room and print the description of all visible ones. It also prints the contents, one level deep, of all containers except the thief.  
  
Finally in the last block, if the room description is printed because we arrived here by movement, the room action is called with the special verb ```WALK-IN``` to allow handling when the player enters a room.  
  
A side note: There is probably a bug with the ```PROG```-block in the original MDL code. The intention was probably to only enclose the first and the second block with the ```PROG```. That would make the ```RETURN``` when printing the "dark" message exit the ```PROG```-block but allow the call to room action with ```WALK-IN```. As it is written now, where the ```PROG```-block encloses all the function, the ```WALK-IN``` is skipped when printing the "dark" message. This doesn't have any significant impact on this game but makes a small difference.  
Now:
```
You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east, a wooden door
with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed
shut, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
There is a trophy case here.
A brass lantern is on the trophy case.

>move rug
With a great effort, the carpet is moved to one side of the room.
With the rug removed, the dusty cover of a closed trap-door appears.
>open
The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
into darkness.
>d
It is now completely dark.  You will probably fall into a pit.
>
```
As (probably) intended:
```
You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east, a wooden door
with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed
shut, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
There is a trophy case here.

The trap door crashes shut behind you, and you hear someone barring it.
```
## Handling the inventory
Picking up and dropping objects; and listing what you carry are basic actions for all adventure games.  
  
Starting with ```TAKE```, the checks done are in the order:  
1. If the direct object is not a noun but an adjective; print message an exit.  
2. If no direct object is supplied but room only contains one object; use that. Otherwise print message and exit.  
3. If direct object is inside a container; use container instead.  
4. Test if object is takeable, in room and that there is room in the inventory; otherwise print message and exit.  
5. Give objects action routine opportunity to handle the ```TAKE```.
6. If there is no action routine or the routine returns false; move object to inventory and print message.

```DROP``` is pretty much the reverse of ```TAKE```, but remember that ```THROW```, ```POUR``` and ```GIVE``` also directs here.  
1. If the direct object is not a noun but an adjective; print message an exit.  
2. If no direct object is supplied but the inventory only contains one object; use that. Otherwise print message and exit.  
3. If there is an indirect object and the direct object is not carried; switch direct and indirect object. This means that both ```GIVE WATER TO TROLL``` and ```GIVE TROLL THE WATER``` gets parsed as ```GIVE WATER TROLL```.  
4. Test if object is carried and then move it to room.  
5. If the verb are ```GIVE``` or ``` THROW``` and there is no indirect object but an enemy in the room; use that enemy as indirect object.  
6. Give object action routine opportunity to handle the ```DROP```.
7. If there is no action routine or the routine returns false; print correct message.

```INVENT``` is very simple. We only loop over all objects in the inventory and print their short description. If any object is a container we also list the content of that container (only one level down).
