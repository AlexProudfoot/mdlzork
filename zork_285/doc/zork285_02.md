# Converting Zork 285 from MDL to ZIL - Part 2 - Extracting the Dictionary
This is part 2 in an ongoing series. Part 1 is [here](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/doc/zork285_01.md).  
  
In this part we will extract and examine the buzzwords, directions and verbs. The nouns will be examined and added later when we extract the OBJECTs in the next part.
## The WORDS-oblist and what is an OBLIST in MDL?
Using the trick (logging in as one of the ```WINNERs``` and then use ```Ctrl-G``` to stop execution of the game) described in the previous part to debug the compiled game in the MUD54 interpreter we can examine the WORDS variable.
```

```
We see that this variable contains an OBLIST with all the verbs, directions and buzzwords. So what is an OBLIST?  
  
Well, OBLISTs are lookup lists of ATOMs and the link between each ATOMs name and its content. OBLISTs are usually used to keep track of all names in current context so that you can use the same name for a local variable inside a function as a variable in another function or a variable at the global level without conflict. But an OBLIST is a perfectly legal datatype to use for other purposes, as it is used here. The data in an OBLIST can be referred to with the ```!-<OBLIST>```-syntax and if we can examine one of the ATOMs in the WORDS-oblist like this:
```
,TAKE!-WORDS$
#VERB [TAKE!-WORDS TAKE T]
```
TAKE is obviously an ATOM of the VERB-type.  
  
For more on MDL and OBLISTs I recommend [The MDL Programming Language by S. W. Galley and Greg Pfister](https://mdl-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  
  
## The BUZZ-, DIRECTION- and VERB-type
In the file [```DEFS 81 [Jun 30 1977]```](https://github.com/MITDDC/zork-1977-07/blob/main/zork/9005143/marc/defs.81) are the definitions for the BUZZ-, DIRECTION- and VERB-type:
```
<NEWTYPE BUZZ STRING>

<NEWTYPE DIRECTION ATOM>

<NEWTYPE VERB
	 VECTOR
	 '<<PRIMTYPE VECTOR> ATOM
			     <OR APPLICABLE FALSE>
			     VDECL
			     STRING
			     <OR ATOM FALSE>
			     FIX>> 

<MSETG VNAME 1>
<MSETG VFCN 2>
<MSETG VARGS 3>
<MSETG VSTR 4>
<MSETG VACTION? 5>
<MSETG VMAX 6>
```
The BUZZ and DIRECTION are pretty straight forward. BUZZ is a simple string and DIRECTION is a new ATOM. VERB on the other hand is a VECTOR with six slots. The slots are named VNAME, VFCN, VARGS, VSTR, VACTION? and VMAX respectively. We will return to these later.  
  
## Extracting more information from WORDS
This is a small MDL-function that will extract out more information from WORDS.
```
<DEFINE DICTIONARY ("AUX" (WTMP ,WORDS))
    <REPEAT (WOBL)
        <SET WOBL <1 .WTMP>>
        <REPEAT ()
            <PRIN1 <1 .WOBL>>
            <PRINC "  ">
            <COND (<GASSIGNED? <1 .WOBL>>
                <COND (<TYPE? ,<1 .WOBL> VERB>
                        <PRINC "#VERB  ">
                        <PRIN1 <1 ,<1 .WOBL>>> <PRINC "  ">         ;"VNAME"
                        <COND (<TYPE? <2 ,<1 .WOBL>> RSUBR-ENTRY>
                            <PRIN1 <2 <2 ,<1 .WOBL>>>> <PRINC "  ">);"VFCN"
                              (T <PRIN1 <3 ,<1 .WOBL>>> <PRINC "  ">)>
                        <PRIN1 <3 ,<1 .WOBL>>> <PRINC "  ">         ;"VARGS"
                        <PRIN1 <4 ,<1 .WOBL>>> <PRINC "  ">         ;"VSTR"
                        <PRIN1 <5 ,<1 .WOBL>>> <PRINC "  ">         ;"VACTION?"
                        <PRIN1 <6 ,<1 .WOBL>>> <PRINC "  ">)        ;"VMAX"
                      (T <PRIN1 ,<1 .WOBL>>)>)>
            <TERPRI>
            <SET WOBL <REST .WOBL>>
            <COND (<EMPTY? .WOBL> <RETURN>)>
            <AGAIN>>
        <SET WTMP <REST .WTMP>>
        <COND (<EMPTY? .WTMP> <RETURN>)>
        <AGAIN>>>
```
And if you run this (and reformat the output a bit) you get the following table:
```
                TYPE        VNAME           VFCN        VARGS   VSTR         VACTION?   VMAX

## Converting to ZIL
### BUZZWORDS
These are pretty simple, you just add them to the vocabulary with the BUZZ keyword. [[defs.zil](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/defs.zil)]
```
<BUZZ TO THIS AT TURN THE OVER AN A>
```
### DIRECTIONS
The directions are organised in patterns like this:
```
NORTH!-WORDS    #DIRECTION  NORTH!-WORDS
N!-WORDS        #DIRECTION  NORTH!-WORDS
```
You can read this as N is a synonym to NORTH. Add the directions to the vocabulary with the DIRECTION keyword and add the synonyms with the SYNONYM keyword. [[defs.zil](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/defs.zil)]
```
<DIRECTIONS NORTH EAST WEST SOUTH NE NW SE SW UP DOWN ENTER EXIT CLIMB CROSS>
<SYNONYM NORTH N>
<SYNONYM EAST E>
<SYNONYM WEST W>
<SYNONYM SOUTH S>
<SYNONYM UP U>
<SYNONYM DOWN D>
<SYNONYM EXIT OUT>
<SYNONYM ENTER IN>
<SYNONYM CROSS TRAVE>
```
If you are observant you will notice that LEAVE is missing as a synonym to EXIT. This is because LEAVE will be in conflict with the noun LEAVES and therefore we will need to make a special handling of this direction later when we parse.
### VERBS
Verbs are a little more complicated and look lie this.
```
                TYPE        VNAME           VFCN        VARGS   VSTR         VACTION?   VMAX
                ----        -----           ----        -----   ----         --------   ----
TAKE!-WORDS     #VERB       TAKE!-WORDS     TAKE            0   "Take what?"        T      2
GET!-WORDS      #VERB       TAKE!-WORDS     TAKE            0   "Take what?"        T      2
CARRY!-WORDS    #VERB       TAKE!-WORDS     TAKE            0   "Take what?"        T      2
HOLD!-WORDS     #VERB       TAKE!-WORDS     TAKE            0   "Take what?"        T      2
```
As one can see they are also grouped around an action with a couple of synonyms. The ```VFCN``` is the function associated with this action, ```VARGS, VSTR, VACTION? and VMAX``` are values used during the parsing. In ZIL we define the verbs with the SYNTAX and the SYNONYM keywords. ```VARGS, VSTR, VACTION? and VMAX``` are implemented as ROUTINEs that will return the correct value as in the table. [[aact.zil](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/aact.zil)] [[defs.zil](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/defs.zil)]

			 <RTRUE>)
		  (T <RFALSE>)>>
```
```VNO=?``` is a helper ROUTINE that compares up to 7 verbs and returns true if they are the same. ```<VNO=? W?GET W?TAKE>``` will, for example, return true.  
  
The ```VNO```-routine returns the V1 part of the word. For Z4 and later versions of ZIL the vocabulary words have the following information for each word:
```
Byte 0-5 Up to 9 zchars in the word
Byte 6   Part-of-speech. BUZZ, DIRECTION, PREPOSITION, ADJECTIVE, VERB or NOUN
Byte 7   V1. Word number 0-255.
Byte 8   V2. Used together with V1 for nouns to get up to 65536 nouns.
```
