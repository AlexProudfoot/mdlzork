# Recreating Zork 285 from MDL to ZIL - Part 3 - Extracting definitions for rooms and objects
This is part 3 in an ongoing series. The previous part: Part 2 - Extracting the dictionary is [here](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/doc/zork285_02.md).  
  
In this part we will extract all the definitions for rooms and objects.
## The ROOM-type
In the file [```DEFS 81 [Jun 30 1977]```](https://github.com/MITDDC/zork-1977-07/blob/main/zork/9005143/marc/defs.81) we find this definitions for the ROOM-type (I've added a description for each position in the vector):
```
; "ROOM DEFINITIONS
    1. ROOM ID (NAME)
    2. LONG DESCRIPTION
    3. SHORT DESCRIPTION
    4. VISITED SWITCH
    5. ENDOGENOUS LIGHT SOURCE SWITCH
    6. EXITS FROM ROOM
    7. ROOM-ACTION FUNCTION
"

<MSETG RID 1>     ;"Up to five character room identification"
<MSETG RDESC1 2>  ;"Long description"

<MSETG RSEEN? 4>  ;"Have room been visited?"
<MSETG RLIGHT? 5> ;"Do room have light?"
<MSETG REXITS 6>  ;"Exits from room (ROOM, CEXIT or NEXIT)"
<MSETG ROBJS 7>   ;"Objects in room (VECTOR of OBJECTS, done the other way around in ZIL)"
<MSETG RACTION 8> ;"Room-action FUNCTION"
<MSETG RVARS 9>   ;"Variables for ROOM (precursor to room flags)"
<MSETG RVAL 10>   ;"Value for visiting room (for scoring)"

; "EXITS ARE DIRECTION/ROOM-CEXIT PAIRS"

<NEWTYPE EXIT 
	 VECTOR
	 '<<PRIMTYPE VECTOR> [REST ATOM <OR ROOM CEXIT NEXIT>]>>

; "CONDITION EXITS ARE CONDITION FLAG, DESCRIPTION, AND ROOM"
   
<NEWTYPE CEXIT
	 VECTOR
	 '<<PRIMTYPE VECTOR> ATOM ROOM <OR FALSE STRING>>>

<MSETG CXFLAG 1>
<MSETG CXROOM 2>
<MSETG CXSTR 3>

<NEWTYPE NEXIT STRING>
```
The EXITs are defined with an ATOM specifying the DIRECTION and then a ROOM, a CEXIT or NEXIT. A CEXIT is an ATOM that evaluates to true
or false and the ROOM to go to if true and the message to print if false. A NEXIT is a message to print when player tries to move in that direction.  
  
## Extracting all the information about the ROOMs
If we examine the ATOM ´´´ROOMS´´´, we find:
```

Obviously there is more information and with this little MDL-function we will be able to extract it.

If we run it we get the following:

discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on the

MAINT!-ROOMS
"You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for Flood
Control Dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
the valuable equipment is gone. On the wall in front of you is a panel
of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC. However, they are of different
color: Red, Brown, Yellow, and Blue. The doors to this room are in the
west and south ends."

(See Appendix A for full output.)
```
For "Treasure Room" (the first room) this translates to:
```
RID     = TREAS
RDESC1  = "This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number of 
           discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on the 
	   floor."
RDESC2  = "Treasure Room"
RSEEN?  = False
RLIGHT? = False
REXITS  = Down to "Cyclops Room"
ROBJS   = Chalice
RACTION = TREASURE-ROOM
RVARS   = 0
RVAL    = 25
```
## Converting ROOMs to ZIL
We begin by adding new property definitions to be able to support these inside ROOMs ([defs.zil](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/defs.zil)).
```
;"ROOM DEFINITIONS
  Good practice is to define new object properties with PROPDEF. It's not
  requiered but you then could have a default value for them and wouldn't
  need to specify the property when they have the default value."
  . 
<PROPDEF RDESC1 <>>   ;"LONG DESCRIPTION, <> = handled by routine"
<PROPDEF RDESC2 <>>   ;"SHORT DESCRIPTION"
<PROPDEF RSEEN? <>>   ;"VISITED SWITCH"
<PROPDEF RLIGHT? <>>  ;"ENDOGENOUS LIGHT SOURCE SWITCH"
<PROPDEF RACTION <>>  ;"ROOM-ACTION FUNCTION"
<PROPDEF RVARS 0>		
<PROPDEF RVAL 0>      ;"VALUE FOR VISITING"
```
And then we can actually define up all ROOMs and their connections ([aact.zil](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/aact.zil)). We 
have to wait with the OBJECTs because thay are added the other way around in ZIL, i.e. each OBJECT 
have a pointer to its parent OBJECT instead. We also use false (```<>```) in ```RDESC1``` instead of an empty string to refer the long description to a routine.
Note that in ZIL we define the rooms in the reverse order. This is because the order is significant for the thiefs movement and in ZIL normally 
added in reverse order. We will examine this more when we return to the thief. 
```

      (RDESC1

the valuable equipment is gone. On the wall in front of you is a panel|
of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC. However, they are of different|
color: Red, Brown, Yellow, and Blue. The doors to this room are in the|
west and south ends.")
      (RDESC2 "Maintenance Room")
      (RSEEN? <>)
      (RLIGHT? <>)
      (SOUTH TO LOBBY)
      (WEST TO LOBBY)
      (RACTION MAINT-ROOM)
      (RVARS 0)
      (RVAL 0)>

<ROOM TREAS-R           ;"Was TREAS"
      (IN ROOMS)
      (RDESC1 
"This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number of|
discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on the|
floor.")
      (RDESC2 "Treasure Room")
      (RSEEN? <>)
      (RLIGHT? <>)
      (DOWN TO CYCLO-R)
      (RACTION TREASURE-ROOM)
      (RVARS 0)
      (RVAL 25)>
```
Notes:
* TREAS is renamed TREAS-R to avoid name conflict with the routine TREAS.
* ```|``` in ZIL forces a linebreak.

Maybe you already noticed but all texts inside this game always prints two spaces after
a full stop. This is a [relic](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/two-spaces-after-period/) from 
the typewriter days and when all fonts where ```monospaced```. Normally ZILF will remove
these double spaces and replace them with a single one. This line in [zork_285.zil](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/zork_285.zil)
preserves all spaces:
```
;"Force the two spaces after a full stop to be printed."
<SETG PRESERVE-SPACES? T>
```
## The OBJECT-type
Just like for rooms OBJETs have a type defintion in the file [```DEFS 81 [Jun 30 1977]```](https://github.com/MITDDC/zork-1977-07/blob/main/zork/9005143/marc/defs.81). The definition in defs.81 are actually a bit newer and the one from June 14 only have 13 slots, as below:
```
 1 OID       ATOM                   ;"unique name, SETG'd to this"
 2 ODESC1    STRING                 ;"description when not carried"
 3 ODESC2    STRING                 ;"short description"
 4 ODESCO    <OR STRING FALSE>      ;"description when untouched"
 5 OACTION   RAPPLIC                ;"object-action"
 6 OCONTENTS <LIST [REST OBJECT]>   ;"list of contents"
 7 OCAN      <OR FALSE OBJECT>      ;"what contains this"
 8 OFLAGS    <PRIMTYPE WORD>        ;"flags THIS MUST BE SAME OFFSET AS AFLAGS!"
                1 VISIBLE
                2 READABLE
 9 OTOUCH?   <OR ATOM FALSE>        ;"has this been touched?"
10 OLIGHT?   FIX                    ;"light producer?"
                -1 OFF
                 1 ON
                 0 NO LIGHT PRODUCER
11 OFVAL     FIX                    ;"value for finding"
12 OTVAL     FIX                    ;"value for putting in trophy case"
13 OREAD     <OR FALSE STRING>      ;"reading material">
```
  
## Extracting all the information about the OBJECTs
If we examine the ATOM ´´´OBJECTS´´´, we find:
```
,OBJECTS$
(#OBJECT [THIEF ] #OBJECT [PAINT painting] #OBJECT [CHALI chalice] #OBJECT [CYCLO ] #OBJECT [SCREW

#OBJECT [PEARL pearl necklace] #OBJECT [BAR platinum bar] #OBJECT [KEYS set of skeleton keys]
#OBJECT [BAGCO bag of coins] #OBJECT [BONES ] #OBJECT [TROLL ] #OBJECT [PILE pile of leaves]
#OBJECT [RUG carpet] #OBJECT [LAMP lamp] #OBJECT [DOOR ] #OBJECT [KNIFE knife] #OBJECT [ROPE rope]
#OBJECT [WATER water in BOTTL] #OBJECT [TROPH trophy case] #OBJECT [BOTTL bottle WATER ] #OBJECT [

```
As with ROOMs we can use a MDL-function to extract more information.
```

        <SET OBJTMP <REST .OBJTMP>>
        <COND (<EMPTY? .OBJTMP> <RETURN>)>
        <AGAIN>>>
```
If we run it we get the following (listing only PAINT & WATER):
```
PAINT!-OBJECTS
"A masterpiece by a neglected genius is here."
"painting"
"Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on
the far wall is a work of unparalleled beauty."

(See Appendix B for full output.)
```
For "painting" this translates to:
```
OID       = PAINT
ODESC1    = "A masterpiece by a neglected genius is here."
ODESC2    = "painting"
ODESCO    = "Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on

OACTION   = False
OCONTENTS = Empty list
OCAN      = False
OFLAGS    = 1
OTOUCH?   = False
OLIGHT?   = 0
OFVAL     = 4
OTVAL     = 7
OREAD     = False
```
There is also an OBLIST for the objects that connect the objects with heir synonyms. Another little MDL-function:
```
<DEFINE OBJ-SYNONYMS ("AUX" (WTMP <MOBLIST OBJECTS>))
    <REPEAT (WOBL)
        <SET WOBL <1 .WTMP>>
        <REPEAT ()
            <PRIN1 <1 .WOBL>>
            <PRINC "     ">
            ;"Unassigned are probably ADJECTIVES." 
            <COND (<GASSIGNED? <1 .WOBL>> <PRIN1 ,<1 .WOBL>>)>
            <TERPRI>
            <SET WOBL <REST .WOBL>>
            <COND (<EMPTY? .WOBL> <RETURN>)>

        <SET WTMP <REST .WTMP>>
        <COND (<EMPTY? .WTMP> <RETURN>)>
        <AGAIN>>>
```
We can extract the synonyms.

YELLO, RED, BLUE & BROWN are not connected to any object and are here as some sort of first attempt to define adjectives.  
  
Now we have all the ingredients to define the objects in ZIL.
  
## Converting OBJECTs to ZIL
First we add the new property definitions to objects to support the OBJECTSs ([defs.zil](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/defs.zil)).
```
;"OBJECT DEFINITIONS"

<PROPDEF ODESC1 <>>     ;"DESCRIPTION WHEN ON GROUND"
<PROPDEF ODESC2 <>>     ;"SHORT DESCRIPTION"
<PROPDEF ODESC0 <>>     ;"DESCRIPTION WHEN UNTOUCHED"
<PROPDEF OACTION <>>    ;"APPLICABLE"
<PROPDEF OFLAGS 0>      ;"RANDOM FLAGS
                            1 VISIBLE
                            2 READABLE"
<PROPDEF OTOUCH? <>>    ;"HAS THIS BEEN TOUCHED?"
<PROPDEF OLIGHT? 0>     ;"LIGHT PRODUCER?
                           -1 OFF
                            1 ON
                            0 NO LIGHT PRODUCER"
<PROPDEF OFVAL 0>       ;"VALUE FOR FINDING IT"
<PROPDEF OTVAL 0>       ;"VALUE FOR PUTTING IN TROPHY CASE"
<PROPDEF ORAND <>>      ;"RANDOM SLOT"
<PROPDEF OREAD <>>      ;"TEXT WHEN READING"
```
As with the ROOMs we use ```<>``` instead of an empty string.  
The result is in ([aact.zil](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/zork_285/aact.zil)).  
The big difference between the definitions in MDL and in ZIL is that in ZIL the location of the objects is specified in the object instead of being defined in the container (ROBJS in room or OCONTENTS in objects). WATER is, for example, ```(IN BOTTL)``` instead of defined in the OCONTENTS of BOTTL and PAINT is ```(IN GALLE)``` instead of defined in the ROBJS of GALLE.  
Note that, as with the rooms, the objects are in the reverse order. This is because the order will affect in which order untoched objects are listed in room descriptions. 
```
<OBJECT WATER 
	(IN BOTTL)
	(SYNONYM WATER LIQUI H2O)
	(ODESC1 "Water")
	(ODESC2 "water")
	(ODESC0 "There is some water here")
	(OACTION WATER-FUNCTION)
	(OFLAGS 1)
	(OTOUCH? <>)
	(OLIGHT? 0)
	(OFVAL 0)
	(OTVAL 0)
	(ORAND <>)
	(OREAD <>)>

<OBJECT PAINT 
    (IN GALLE)
    (SYNONYM PAINT ART MASTE CANVA)
    (ODESC1 "A masterpiece by a neglected genius is here.")
    (ODESC2 "painting")
    (ODESC0 
"Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on|
the far wall is a work of unparalleled beauty.")
    (OACTION <>)
    (OFLAGS 1)
    (OTOUCH? <>)
    (OLIGHT? 0)
    (OFVAL 4)
    (OTVAL 7)   
    (ORAND <>)
    (OREAD <>)>
```
Finally we need to add the "adjectives" to the vocabulary. If we don't do this, these words will be unrecognised by the parser.
```
;"Add these as adjectives. In the original they are only defined as ATOMs 
  in the OBJECTS OBLIST."
<VOC "RED" ADJECTIVE>
<VOC "BLUE" ADJECTIVE>
<VOC "YELLO" ADJECTIVE>
<VOC "BROWN" ADJECTIVE>
```

"\"                Guide Book to
                Flood Control Dam #3

  Flood Control Dam #3 (FCD#3) was constructed in year 783
of the Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive
power of the Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant
of 37 million zorkmids from the Central Bureaucracy and
your omnipotent local tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.
This impressive structure is composed of 3.7 cubic feet
of concrete, is 256 feet tall from the center, and 193 feet
wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind the dam has
a volume of 37 million cubic feet, an area of 12 million
square feet, and a shore line of 3.6 million feet.
  The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground
breaking to the dedication. It required a work force of
384 slaves, 34 slave drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves,
and a partridge in a pear tree. The work was managed by
a command team composed of 2345 bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries
(at least two of which can type), 12,256 paper shufflers,
52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape processors, and
nearly one million dead trees.
  We will now point out some of the more interesting features
of FCD#3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities:
        1) You start your tour here in the Dam Lobby.
           You will notice on your right that ........."
